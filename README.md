## Getting started with GEEDiT
**If you have not used Google Earth Engine before you will need to [create a Google Earth Engine account](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register)** and register for a **[non-commerical cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/earth-engine/welcome)** before you can use GEEDiT. A step-by-step guide on how to do this can be found [here](https://github.com/jmlea16/GEE-Tutorials/blob/main/Signing%20up%20and%20creating%20a%20new%20Cloud%20Project.md).  Note that use of GEEDiT through this route is **not** permitted for commercial purposes.
